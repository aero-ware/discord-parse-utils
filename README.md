# discord-parse-utils

Small package that contains useful utility functions for writing Discord bots.

### Install

```
npm i --save discord-parse-utils
```
```
yarn add discord-parse-utils
```

#### This package might not even work! If so, just download the code from [github](https://github.com/cursorsdottsx/discord-parse-utils).

#### This was made in TypeScript and I'm too lazy to make it into JS
